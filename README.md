## 🧭 Overview
This project showcases a financial performance dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard provides an end-to-end overview of sales, profit, and discount patterns across various products, customer segments, and countries. 
The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter data by Product, Names, Segments, and Quarters using slicers.

---
## 📚 Story of the Data
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Power BI’s sample dataset library, commonly used for practice and demonstration purposes.

It simulates a real-world scenario involving:
- Sales data
- Product performance
- Regional contributions
- Quarterly and monthly trends
- Discounts and profit margins

The dataset served as a perfect sandbox to practice real business analysis techniques using visual storytelling.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Splitting

The data came mostly clean, but I performed light preprocessing:

### 🧼 Cleaning Performed:
- Changed the format of some columns (e.g., converted text to categorical, formatted date fields).
- Ensured consistency in date types for time-based visualizations.
- Renamed some columns for better clarity in the visuals.

### 🔁 Variable Breakdown:
- **Dependent Variable:** `Profit`
- **Independent Variables:** `Gross Sales`, `Discount`, `Country`, `Product`, `Segment`, `Month`, `Quarter`

There was no train-test split since this was a purely analytical (non-predictive) dashboard.

## 👀 Pre-Analysis Observations

Before diving into visuals, a glance at the data revealed:
- A large number of products are sold across multiple countries.
- The Government and Enterprise segments are dominating in terms of volume.
- Profit margins varied heavily across time and product lines.

---
## 📈 In-Analysis Observations

As the dashboard was developed, the following trends became evident:

- **Q4 has the highest profit** across all quarters, while **Q1** consistently underperforms.
- **Paseo** emerged as the best-performing product by far, leading in both **Gross Sales** and **Profit**.
- The **Government segment** generates the most revenue but also receives the **largest discounts**.
- **Sales peaks** occur in **October** and **December**, indicating strong year-end performance.
- **US, Canada, and France** contribute the most to total gross sales.

---
## ✅ Post-Analysis & Key Insights

Here are the insights from the dashboard:

- **Paseo** should be prioritized in sales strategy due to its high performance.
- **Q1 needs targeted intervention** to boost performance — perhaps through early-year promotions.
- **Discount policies in the Government segment** may be eroding profits - worth re-evaluating.
- **Mexico is underperforming** — It has potential for market development or strategy review.
- The company should **prepare for Q4 surges** in inventory and staffing, given clear seasonal spikes.

---
## 💡 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations:

1. **Double down on Q4 strategies** – launch targeted campaigns before October.
2. **Revisit pricing and discounting structures** for Government clients.
3. **Expand Paseo’s market reach** and replicate its success in underperforming regions.
4. **Develop Q1-specific sales strategies** to offset its low performance.
5. Continue using **Power BI** to automate and monitor these insights regularly.
